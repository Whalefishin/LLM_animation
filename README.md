# Real-time Animation Generation and Control on Rigged Models via Large Language Models
 
This repository serves as a showroom for various animations generated by large language models (LLM) with the approach described in

This work is part of a larger initiative that utilizes LLMs to create virtual experiences. For more details, please see

Our method takes a rigged 3D model and produces novel animations with natural language descriptions in a matter of seconds. Currently, there are multiple limitations in robustness and excess token usage for complex joint hierarchies. However, it is fascinating that LLMs can manage this at all!

## Animation Generation

The quoted texts are the prompts used to generate the animation.
