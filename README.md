# Real-time Animation Generation and Control on Rigged Models via Large Language Models
 
This repository serves as a showroom for various animations generated by large language models (LLM). Our method takes a rigged 3D model and produces novel animations specified via natural language descriptions in a matter of seconds.

## Animation Generation

The texts in quotes are the prompts used to generate the animation.
